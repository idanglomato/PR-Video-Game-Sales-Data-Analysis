# Practicum Data Science Project
## Video Game Sales Data Analysis

### Description
You work at the online store "Ice" that sells video games from around the world. Data related to user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data are available from open sources. Your task is to identify patterns that determine whether a game can be considered successful or not. By doing so, you can discover the most promising games and plan their advertising campaigns.

You have data available from the year 2016. Let's imagine that it is now December 2016, and you are planning the campaign for the year 2017.

### Objectives
The objectives of this research is as stated below:
1. Identify whether the number of games released each year differ significantly.
2. Identify platform dynamics
    * Identify which platform will grow and which will shrink.
    * Identify which platform that is previously popular but not anymore.
    * Identify how much time is needed for new platform to outshine old platform.
    * Identify whether the number of games sold differ significantly between platforms.
        * If so, which platform sold the most, plot the distribution of the sales amount for that platform.
    * Decide which platform will optimize profit.
3. Decide the period of time that will be used to forecast the future (in this case 2017).
4. Identify whether the sales amounts differ significantly between genres. If so, decide which genre is the most profitable. Decide whether we can generalize the association between genre and sales amounts.
5. Identify whether there is an association between user reviews or critic reviews and sales amount in a pre-selected platform. Compare the conclusion with another platform.
6. Perform profiling for each region:
    * Show top 5 platform and decide the variability between them.
    * Show top 5 genre and describe the difference.
    * Decide whether ESRB rating influences sales amounts in each region.
7. Test these hypothesis:
    * Average user rating for *Xbox One* and *PC* platform is the same.
    * Average user rating for *Action* and *Sports* genre is different.
